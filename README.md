## ðŸ§ª Overview

We introduce **OUI** (Overfittingâ€“Underfitting Indicator), a simple yet powerful diagnostic tool to monitor the training dynamics of deep neural networks and identify the optimal value for **weight decay** â€” without using a validation set.

Unlike traditional validation-based hyperparameter tuning, OUI:
- Converges faster than metrics like accuracy or loss.
- Signals overfitting and underfitting through the internal statistics of the model.
- Provides a reliable early criterion for choosing the regularization strength during training.

## ðŸ“Š Results

OUI was validated across multiple vision benchmarks:

- **DenseNet-BC-100** on **CIFAR-100**
- **EfficientNet-B0** on **TinyImageNet**
- **ResNet-34** on **ImageNet-1K**

Across all experiments, keeping OUI between 0.6 and 0.8 consistently led to improved validation accuracy.
